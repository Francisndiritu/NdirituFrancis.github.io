My experience as an IEBC Clerk at Mathira East in Nyeri County during the 2022 General Election was an incredibly positive one. Despite the long hours and hard work involved in the entire electoral process, I was always met with enthusiasm and support from the local community.

I was responsible for overseeing the election process at the polling station, which included setting up the polling station, registering and verifying voters, distributing the ballots, and counting the votes at the end of the day. I had to ensure that the process was conducted in accordance with the IEBC guidelines, and that the environment was safe and secure for all involved.

The people of Mathira East were incredibly supportive and engaged in the entire process. They were eager to learn about the electoral process and asked questions to ensure they fully understood what was expected of them. It was a joy to witness the enthusiasm of the people and their commitment to fairness and transparency.

I am proud to have been a part of the 2022 General Election in Mathira East and I am grateful to have had the opportunity to serve such a passionate community.</p>
